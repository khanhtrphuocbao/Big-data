# Abstract 
In the current digital era, the volume of data generated from online platforms is enormous. In order to fully utilize and exploit this data resource, it is necessary to build predictive models as well as data storage systems. In this paper, we propose edge models and sentiment classification techniques. We will also discuss the benefits and challenges associated with applying these techniques to a hotel review dataset, highlighting potential applications and the impact of ACSA (Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis) in the broader context of multi-aspect classification analysis for customer feedback and business decision-making. We also build a real-time dashboard interface system using Spark, enabling analysts to base their decisions on real-time situations, combining data on time, transactions, social media, and weather forecasts to accurately determine suitable products to supply to customers.
